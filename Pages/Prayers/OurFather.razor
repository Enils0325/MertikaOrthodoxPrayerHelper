    The Lord's Prayer
</Heading>

<p>
    Our Father, Who art in Heaven,
    <br />
    hallowed be Thy name.
    <br />
    Thy Kingdom come;
    <br />
    Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.
    <br />
    Give us this day our daily bread;
    <br />
    and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us;
    <br />
    and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
    <br />
</p>
