        <p>
            O Lord our God, if I have sinned in anything this day, in word, or deed, or thought, as Thou art good and lovest mankind, forgive me all.
            <br />
            Grant me peaceful and undisturbed sleep; 
            send Thy guardian Angel to protect and keep me from every evil; 
            for Thou art the guardian of our souls and bodies, 
            and unto Thee do we send up glory, 
            to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
            now and ever, and unto ages of ages.
            <Amen />

            O Lord our God, if I have sinned in anything this day, in word, or deed, or thought,
            forgive me all, for You are good and You love mankind.
            <br/>
            Grant me peaceful and undisturbed sleep,
            and deliver me from the assault and attack of the evil one.
            Rouse me at the proper time to glorify You, for blessed are You,
            together with Your Only-begotten Son and Your All-holy Sprit,
            now and forever and to the ages of ages.
