            Having arisen from sleep, we fall down before Thee, O Blessed One, and sing to Thee, O Mighty One, the angelic hymn:
            Holy, Holy, Holy art Thou, O God; through the Theotokos, have mercy on us.
        </p>

        <GloryNowAndForever />

        <p>
            Suddenly the Judge shall come, and the deeds of each shall be revealed;
            but with fear we cry out in the middle of the night:
            Holy, Holy, Holy art Thou, O God;
            through the Theotokos, have mercy on us.

            As we rise from sleep, we fall down before You, our good God, and sing to You the Angels' Hymn:
            Holy, Holy, Holy are you, O God. Through the prayers of the Mother of God, have mercy on us.
        </p>

        <GloryNowAndForever />

        <p>
            Now and ever and unto ages of ages.
            <Amen />

            The Judge will come down suddenly and what everyone has done will be revealed.
            Therefore, with fear we cry out in the early morning:
            Holy, Holy, Holy are You, o God.
            Through the prayers of the Mother of God, have mercy on us.
