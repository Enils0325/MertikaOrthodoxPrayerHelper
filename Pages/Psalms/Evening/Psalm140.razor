            Psalm 140
        </Heading>
        <p>
            Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hear Thou me; give ear unto the voice of my supplication when I cry unto Thee.
            <br/>
            Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense, the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.
            <br/>
            Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door of enclosure about my lips.
            <br/>
            Incline not my heart to evil words, to make excuse with pretexts for sins with men that work iniquity; I shall not join with their chosen.
            <br/>
            The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me; but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head.
            <br/>
            For yet shall my prayer be against their pleasures; their judges have been swallowed up like unto a rock.
            <br/>
            They will hear my words, for they are sweet; as when a clod of earth is broken up upon the ground, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto Hades.
            <br/>
            But my eyes are unto Thee, Lord, O Lord; in Thee have I hoped; take not away my soul.
            <br/>
            Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the stumbling blocks of the workers of iniquity.
            <br/>
            The wicked shall fall into their own net; I am alone until that I pass hence.

            Psalm 140
        </Heading>
        <p>
            I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to You.
            <br/>
            May my prayer be set before You like incense; my uplifted hands, like the evening offering.
            <br/>
            Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.
            <br/>
            Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies.
            <br/>
            Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.
            <br/>
            When their rulers are thrown down from the cliffs, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.
            <br/>
            As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
            <br/>
            But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD the Lord. In You I seek refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless.
            <br/>
            Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the lures of evildoers.
            <br/>
            Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
