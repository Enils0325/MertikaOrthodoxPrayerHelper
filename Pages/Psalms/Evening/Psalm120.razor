        <p>
            I have lifted up mine eyes to the mountains, from whence cometh my help.
            <br/>
            My help cometh from the Lord, Which made heaven and earth.
            <br/>
            Let not thy foot be moved, and let not Him that keepeth thee slumber things for thee.
            <br/>
            Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
            <br/>
            The Lord shall keep thee; the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right hand.
            <br/>
            The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night.
            <br/>
            The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; the Lord shall preserve thy soul.
            <br/>
            The Lord shall preserve thy coming in and thy going out, from this time forth, and even for evermore.

            I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? 
            <br/>
            My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 
            <br/>
            He will not allow your foot to slip; your Protector will not slumber. 
            <br/>
            Behold, the Protector of Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 
            <br/>
            The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is the shade on your right hand. 
            <br/>
            The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. 
            <br/>
            The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul. 
            <br/>
            The LORD will watch over your coming and going, both now and forevermore.
