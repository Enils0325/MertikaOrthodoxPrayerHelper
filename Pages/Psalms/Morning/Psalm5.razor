            Psalm 5
        </Heading>
        <p>
            Unto my words, give ear, O Lord;
            hear my cry.
            Attend unto the voice of my supplication,
            O my King and my God;
            for unto Thee will I pray, O Lord.
            In the morning Thou shalt hear my voice.
            In the morning shall I stand before Thee,
            and Thou shalt look upon me;
            for not a God that willest iniquity art Thou.
            He that worketh evil shall not dwell near Thee,
            nor shall transgressors abide before Thine eyes.
            Thou hast hated all them that work iniquity;
            Thou shalt destroy all them that speak a lie.
            A man that is bloody and deceitful shall the Lord abhor.
            But as for me, in the multitude of Thy mercy shall I go into Thy house;
            I shall worship toward Thy holy temple in fear of Thee.
            O Lord, guide me in the way of Thy righteousness;
            because of mine enemies, make straight my way before Thee.
            For in their mouth there is no truth;
            their heart is vain.
            Their throat is an open sepulchre,
            with their tongues have they spoken deceitfully;
            judge them, O God.
            Let them fall down on account of their own devisings;
            according to the multitude of their ungodliness,
            cast them out, for they have embittered Thee, O Lord.
            And let all them be glad that hope in Thee;
            they shall ever rejoice,
            and Thou shalt dwell among them.
            And all shall glory in Thee that love Thy name,
            for Thou shalt bless the righteous.
            O Lord, as with a shield of Thy good pleasure hast Thou crowned us.

            Psalm 5
        </Heading>
        <p>
            Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning.
            <br />
            Attend to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray.
            <br />
            In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice; at daybreak I lay my plea before You and wait in expectation.
            <br />
            For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; no evil can dwell with You.
            <br />
            The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all workers of iniquity.
            <br />
            You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
            <br />
            But I will enter Your house by the abundance of Your loving devotion; in reverence I will bow down toward Your holy temple.
            <br />
            Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me.
            <br />
            For not a word they speak can be trusted; destruction lies within them. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.
            <br />
            Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own devices. Drive them out for their many transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.
            <br />
            But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever shout for joy. May You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.
            <br />
            For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous; You surround them with the shield of Your favor.
