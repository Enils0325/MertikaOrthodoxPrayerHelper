            Psalm 142
        </Heading>
        <p>
            O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear unto my supplication in Thy truth; hearken unto me in Thy righteousness.<br/>
            And enter not into judgement with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.<br/>
            For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath humbled my life down to the earth.<br/>
            He hath sat me in darkness as those that have been long dead, and my spirit within me is become despondent; within me my heart is troubled.<br/>
            I remembered days of old, I meditated on all Thy works, I pondered on the creations of Thy hands.<br/>
            I stretched forth my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee like a waterless land.<br/>
            Quickly hear me, O Lord; my spirit hath fainted away.<br/>
            Turn not Thy face away from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.<br/>
            Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning; for in Thee have I put my hope.<br/>
            Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk; for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.<br/>
            Rescue me from mine enemies, O Lord; unto Thee have I fled for refuge. Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God.<br/>
            Thy good Spirit shall lead me in the land of uprightness; for Thy name's sake, O Lord, shalt Thou quicken me.<br/>
            In Thy righteousness shalt Thou bring my soul out of affliction, and in Thy mercy shalt Thou utterly destroy mine enemies.<br/>
            And Thou shalt cut off all them that afflict my soul, for I am Thy servant.
