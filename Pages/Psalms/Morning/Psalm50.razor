            Psalm 50
        </Heading>
        <p>
            Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgression.
            <br />
            Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
            <br />
            For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.
            <br />
            Against Thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that Thou mightest be justified in Thy words, and prevail when Thou art judged.
            <br />
            For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me.
            <br />
            For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou made manifest unto me.
            <br />
            Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
            <br />
            Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; the bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice.
            <br />
            Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
            <br />
            Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
            <br />
            Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
            <br />
            Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and with Thy governing Spirit establish me.
            <br />
            I shall teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn back unto Thee.
            <br />
            Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.
            <br />
            O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.
            <br />
            For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given it; with whole-burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased.
            <br />
            A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit; a heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise.
            <br />
            Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Sion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded.
            <br />
            Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole-burnt offerings.
            <br />
            Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.

        <Heading HeadingKind="HeadingKind">
            Psalm 50
        </Heading>
        <p>
            Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your loving devotion; according to Your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.
            <br />
            Wash me clean of my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
            <br />
            For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.
            <br />
            Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You may be proved right when You speak and blameless when You judge.
            <br />
            Surely I was brought forth in iniquity; I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
            <br />
            Surely You desire truth in the inmost being; You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
            <br />
            Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
            <br />
            Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones You have crushed rejoice.
            <br />
            Hide Your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
            <br />
            Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
            <br />
            Cast me not away from Your presence; take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
            <br />
            Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.
            <br />
            Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners will return to You.
            <br />
            Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.
            <br />
            O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
            <br />
            For You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; You take no pleasure in burnt offerings.
            <br />
            The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
            <br />
            In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.
            <br />
            Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, in whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.
